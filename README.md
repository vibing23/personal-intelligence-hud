# 📱 Personal Intelligence HUD

A collection of premium, data-driven home screen widgets for iOS, built with JavaScript (Scriptable).

These widgets are designed to visualize **time scarcity**, **productivity density**, and **device telemetry** in real-time. No external API keys required. Zero configuration.

## 📦 The Collection

### 1. Orbital HUD (`orbital-hud.js`)
A heads-up display inspired by the Apple Watch Ultra.
* **Visualizes:** Year, Month, and Day progress as concentric rings.
* **Features:** Adaptive Theme (Light/Dark mode), 4K Retina rendering, dynamic battery monitor.
* **Use Case:** Keeping track of macro and micro time goals at a glance.

### 2. IsoCity Skyline (`iso-city.js`)
An isometric projection engine that renders your daily calendar as a 3D city.
* **Visualizes:** Your schedule density. Tall buildings = Busy hours. Flat ground = Free time.
* **Features:** Procedural generation, 3D coordinate mapping.
* **Use Case:** instantly spotting "deep work" blocks vs. "meeting heavy" blocks.

### 3. Energy Optimizer (energy-optimizer.js)
A peak performance tracker that tells you exactly when to do your hardest work.

Visualizes: Your energy levels throughout the day (6AM-10PM) as a live gradient curve with golden peak window highlighting.
Features: Real-time energy score calculation based on circadian rhythms, smart scheduling suggestions, color-coded performance zones (Peak/High/Moderate/Low), pulsing current-time indicator.
Use Case: Stop wasting your best hours on email. Block your peak performance window (typically 10AM-12PM) for deep work and maximize productivity by working with your biology, not against it.
